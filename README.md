## Title of the Project:
AI-Driven Personalized Medical Chatbot for Health Consultations

## Description:
The integration of a chatbot within a healthcare system, aimed at streamlining medical consultations and improving patient engagement by providing accurate, real-time responses to health-related queries.

## Features:
(01) Implements advanced neural network methods for natural language understanding.
(02) Deployable via a framework-based application for scalability.
(03) High accuracy and low response time.
(04) Responses are based on structured medical data and health guidelines.
(05) Utilizes JSON data format for medical records and query responses.

## Requirements:
(01) Operating System: 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
(02) Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the medical chatbot system.
(03) Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, HuggingFace for embeddings.
(04) NLP Libraries: LangChain and transformers for advanced conversational capabilities.
(05) Version Control: Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
(06) IDE: VS Code for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
(07) Additional Dependencies: scikit-learn, FAISS for vector storage, Fastapi for deployment.
